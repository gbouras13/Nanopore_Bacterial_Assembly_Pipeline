# Nanopore_Bacterial_Assembly_Pipeline
Pipeline to assemble many bacterial assemblies from Nanopore data

* Issue with the medaka env
* Somehow got it working in a conda env on the HPC, so I copied the dependencies to files

```
conda list -e > req.txt
```

* Then included them in the medaka.yml


# TO DO - write assembly_info.txt to summary folder
